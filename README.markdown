## ScreenSaviour

![I will move your mouse ... periodically](http://psastrike.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/schopenhauer.jpg)

ScreenSaviour is a ridiculous Python/Tkinter UI that was written quickly to do one dumb thing--move a windows mouse
periodically so as to disable an admin controlled windows screen saver.

## Install

There are no frills. You must have python installed on windows and then just run it. This has only been used on windows
machines.
