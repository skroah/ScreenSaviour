## ScreenSaviour

![I will move your mouse....periodically.](/saviour.jpg "Screen Saviour")

ScreenSaviour is a ridiculous code snippet that was written quickly to do one dumb thing--move a windows mouse periodically so as
to disable an admin controlled windows screen saver.

## Install

There are no frills. You must have python installed on windows and then just run it. This has only been used on windows machines.
